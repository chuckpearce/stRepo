### Take out the Dog

<b>Files</b><br>
SmartApp: apps/takeOutDog.groovy
<br>Device Type: devices/takeOutDog.groovy

<b>Description</b><br>
This application was designed as a companion to SmartAlarm. The need was to allow someone to leave a door while the system is disarmed, then once returned trigger the alarm system back on. Set the actions to take when the switch is in the on state or the lock is put in an unlock state. This includes a Hello Home, mode change, and/or enabling switches. Next, select when to register as returned. This can be done either by setting the delay time or by selecting a contact sensor. Selecting a contact sensor means that once the door goes open/closed/open/closed it will register that you have returned. Finally select the actions that should occur when you return which are the same as when you leave except the lights will turn off.

<b>How to use</b><br>
Either turn on the "Feed the Dog" device or add a door lock to the application.
